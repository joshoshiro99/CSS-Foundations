-What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?
External CSS is created in a separate file. Internal is created within the <style></style> tag that is placed within the <head></head> tag.
Inline CSS is placed within the elements attribute.

-What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
class selectors use .selector-name{}
id selectors use #id-name{}

-How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
.selector1 .selector2 {

}

-Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
#title.primary{

}

-What does the descendant combinator do?
The descendant combinator applies rules only if the element has the corresponding ancestor - child relationship e.g:
<div class="ancestor">
    <div class="child"> </div>
</div>
.ancestor .child {
    property: value;
}

-Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
The class selector will beat any number of type selectors; the class selector has the higher specificity.
